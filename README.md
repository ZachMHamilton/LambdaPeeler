## Features
**Bulk Operations**: Time is of the essence. And Lambda Peeler understands that. Perform bulk connections and disconnections without a hitch, and with the assurance of compatibility.  

**Risk Mitigation**: Gone are the days of the dreaded trial-and-error. Our built-in compatibility testing feature cross-examines functions with layers, ensuring they're in harmony. This not only guarantees smoother integrations but significantly curtails the risk of runtime failures.  

**Error Handling**: Our robust error messages notify users of failed connection attempts, allowing them to easily troubleshoot problems.

**Direct AWS Integration**: Leveraging the AWS SDK, Lambda Peeler is deeply integrated with AWS services. This ensures real-time operations and a seamless user experience.
