**Web dashboard for managing AWS Lambda functions and layers**
<br>
Lambda Peeler is an intuitive dashboard that puts AWS Lambda functions and associated layers at your fingertips. Listing, connecting, and disconnecting becomes a breeze. Gone are the days of the dreaded trial-and-error. Our built-in compatibility testing feature cross-examines functions with layers, ensuring they're in harmony. This not only guarantees smoother integrations but significantly curtails the risk of runtime failures.
