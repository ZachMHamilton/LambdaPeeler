**Web dashboard for managing AWS Lambda functions and layers**
The Problem
In the evolving world of AWS Lambda, ensuring compatibility between functions and layers is paramount. But here lies the crux: There's no straightforward way to validate if functions resonate with new Layers. Today's developers find themselves at a crossroads â€” test each function one-by-one for compatibility or take a leap of faith and bulk update, risking potential breaking changes. The latter approach leaves one in the dark, uncertain about which function might lead to a production mishap.

The Solution: Lambda Peeler
Lambda Peeler rises to the occasion, offering a seamless solution:

**Effortless Management**: An intuitive dashboard that puts AWS Lambda functions and associated layers at your fingertips. Listing, connecting, and disconnecting becomes a breeze.

**Risk Mitigation**: Gone are the days of the dreaded trial-and-error. Our built-in compatibility testing feature cross-examines functions with layers, ensuring they're in harmony. This not only guarantees smoother integrations but significantly curtails the risk of runtime failures.

**Bulk Operations**: Time is of the essence. And Lambda Peeler understands that. Perform bulk connections and disconnections without a hitch, and with the assurance of compatibility.

**Direct AWS Integration**: Leveraging the AWS SDK, Lambda Peeler is deeply integrated with AWS services. This ensures real-time operations and a seamless user experience.
